# Billing and Architecture

The first live stream video was interesting because it exposed me to what i should expect from a real life job as a cloud engineer. magaret create a scenerio on how one can work in a fast paced environment, listen and come up with a conceptual, logical and physical architecture. The conceptual architectture communicates at a high level the architecture to key stakeholders, while the logical part communicates the technical architecture to engineers and the physical communicates in detail the technical architecture to engineers for clear implementation
