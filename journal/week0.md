# Billing and Architecture

The first live stream video was interesting because it exposed me to what i should expect from a real life job as a cloud engineer. magaret and chris created a scenerio on how one can work in a fast paced environment, listen and come up with a conceptual, logical and physical architecture. The conceptual architectture communicates at a high level the architecture to key stakeholders, while the logical part communicates the technical architecture to engineers and the physical communicates in detail the technical architecture to engineers for clear implementation.


## Budget

- we walked through the process of creating a budget and i created a monthly cost budget on my aws account to notify me through my email when my spend exceeds or is forcasted to exceed my budgeted amount which i set to $100. see screen shot below;
